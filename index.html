        <h2 class="f2-l f3-m f4 green">OUR MISSION</h2>
        <p>TEE Movers for Chinese Church (TMCC) is an independent non-denominational Chinese Christian Organization registered in the United States as 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.  Its primary mission is to equip the missionaries systematically, cultivate healthy Christian leaders for the Kingdom of God through the series of TEE disciple training courses, both in mission fields and local churches, and help the Chinese churches grow up healthily for the Great Commission.</p>
        <h2 class="f2-l f3-m f4 green">OUR STRATEGY</h2>
        <p>To better equip the missionaries before sending them to the mission fields, we partner with SEAN International to provide quality training resources and prepare God’s people for work of service.  TEE (Theological Education by Extension), which is originally developed by SEAN International, is a highly mobile and effective system of training within the local context, based on Home and Group Study led by trained tutors. TEE courses are carefully programmed and well prepared, simple yet profound, and effectively cut through the barriers to unite people of all nations and social and educational levels.</p>
        <h2 class="f2-l f3-m f4 green">OUR MINISTRIES</h2>
        <p>TMCC connects local and global churches to equip and facilitate Chinese missionaries in mission fields all over the world by providing high quality TEE training courses and well-trained TEE tutors.  We offer 15 workbook courses in 4 different languages that will help growth in local church to equip missionaries both for ministry and involve them in ministry.  For example, we teach TEE courses in seminaries in North America, as well as to train facilitators who can lead TEE study groups at Christian mission organizations in Southeast Asia, also to provide Christian leader trainings for local Chinese churches in more than 12 countries.</p>
